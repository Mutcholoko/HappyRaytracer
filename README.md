# HappyRaytracer
Software Raytracer built from scratch using C.

This is a vacation project I'm working on. 
I'm using Peter Shirley's guide, but coding in plain C, instead of C++. I'm doing this to both learn Linear Algebra/Computer Graphics, but also to learn the differences and similarities of working with C as opposed to C++.
The aim of this project is to have a fully working raytracer for Windows, with an executable that you can open in any computer and be happy about raytracing just like I am.
I will be uploading pictures to keep track of the progress.
